# opSys
naive me think building an OS would be cool

## why?
I want to learn more about how computers work(again), and I think this is a good way to do it.
Also, I haven't touched C in a while, and I want to get back into it. Or C++ if I'm feeling adventurous. Let's see how far I get.

## how?
There is no set plan, but I'm going to try to follow the [osdev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) as much as possible. Possibly get stuck, but I'm in no rush. I'm doing this for fun, not for a grade. I'm a machine learning engineer by trade, so at some stage I want to work with low level languages and combine them with my knowledge of embedded systems to build a robot or something. I don't know yet. I'm just going to wing it.
